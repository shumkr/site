<h1>test</h1>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;">hey, you found the test page! nice work. here's some of the things i'm planning on adding to the site.</p>
<h3>——to-add——</h3>
<ul>
  <li>tab-style navigation (at top)</li>
  <li>possibly style as actual folder tabs that switch? or keep it modern.</li>
  <li>add a resume page? feels like it could be odd to have, though, since I probably won't do anything with tech in my career.</li>
  <li>maybe split previous work into short films/miscellaneous?</li>
</ul>
